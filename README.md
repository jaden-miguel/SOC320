SOC320: Computer Applications for Social Science Data

* This course aims to empower students with the knowledge and skills necessary to
produce and understand high quality, quantitative research. I know that statistics can be
intimidating to social scientists! Most of us were drawn to sociology because of a desire
to understand the inequalities that exist in the world around us, in our own lived
experiences or in those that we have observed in the local or global community. It can
be difficult to identify with mathematical concepts when the subjects we are interested in
are fundamentally interactional and relational in nature.

Learning Objectives:
* Methods Assessment: Students will be able to apply the scientific method to
explain social phenomena, evaluate the scientific merit of existing social research,
and correctly evaluate claims of causality in social research.
* Methods Application: Students will be able to design and implement a quantitative
research study.
* Statistical Application: Students will be able to conduct a basic statistical analysis
(including multiple regression to elaborate a causal hypothesis) of social research
data using a computer-based statistical analysis program (R or SPSS).

Independent Research Project
* The best (and most fun) way to demonstrate mastery of the concepts that we cover in
this course is to apply them in a new setting, to a topic that you are passionate about.
Therefore, your final project for the course will be to produce a piece of original research
that uses one of the data sources we have discussed in class, taking the data from its
raw form and manipulating it until it teaches us something meaningful about our social
world.
* Since the focus here is on formulating a research question, identifying relevant data,
processing the data, performing an appropriate analysis, and interpreting the results,
you can choose which format works best for you to accomplish this:
Write an 8-10 page research paper (not including references) in the style of an
academic paper, policy brief, public health report, or other professional
manuscript (we can discuss options) that aligns with the type of employment you
might seek after you graduate
